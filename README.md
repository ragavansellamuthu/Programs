Tips : 

1) Start with an assumption, validate it, and adjust it if necessary.
2) Apply initial filter conditions to simplify the problem.
3) Decide the optimal iteration direction and choose the appropriate start and end points based on the problem requirements.
4) Select the type of loop considering the iteration paramaters.
5) Check if sorting or reversing an array would help solve the problem more efficiently.
6) Choose appropriate data structures.
7) Use built-in methods whenever possible.
8) Check if conditions can be improved or combined to reduce the code.
9) Determine if creating a new array is necessary or if the problem can be solved in-place.
10) Use multiple pointers to optimize iterations and avoid unnecessary nested loops.
11) Analyze edge cases, considering scenarios like empty inputs.
12) Test with different inputs.
13) Always look for specific details in problem statements, as they can often hint at edge cases or ideas for optimization.
14) Ensure that the solution meets the problem constraints.
15) If asked for the number of solutions, focus on calculating the count rather than finding all solutions.
16) If possible, try to avoid using an extra counter variable.
17) Declaring the temporary variable outside the loop reduces memory allocation overhead and improves performance by reusing the variable across iterations.
18) Non-Decreasing Order : Ascending Order with duplicates ; Non-Increasing Order : Descending Order with duplicates.
